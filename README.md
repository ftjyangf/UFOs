# Overview of Project
## The objective this project is to create a user interface that users can easily narrow down the data search result by providing search term for different label.In the process of creating this user interface, we aslo found the area where we can change to improve the search result and more user friendly.

## Result of the Project
### In the user page, there are 5 search forms for each category of the dataset which users can use. with the search function, each search-box can help user narrow down the search result, for the example of the image, we search 'cleveland' in city box, we have 2 results. one is in ohio, one is not, so at this time we can only retrieve the one in ohio by tpye 'oh' in the search box.

## Summary of the page
### The webpack content could be aligned better, expecially the datatable part and the part above the datatable. The search function for the dataset could be improved, if we can provide the possible search team that help user type in the right one, the current version is not good when user typed something is not in the dataset. we can aslo provide the condition when the search term is not founded, so the user can understand what is going with the search order.we can aslo add two buttons that control the ascending or descending order of the data, which can be very helpful when the dataset is hug.
